## Synopsis

LocationBot2.0 is a moderator bot that assists in the moderation of various subreddits. This bot's primary focus is on ensuring that users who post questions to https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdvice include a location in their post.

The source of this bot could be forked and used as a different niche-purposed bot if desired.

## Code Example

N/A

## Motivation

As a frequent reader of /r/LegalAdvice, it was apparent that users often forgot to include their location in the subject or body of their post. Since legal advice is highly location dependent, we decided that LocationBot could solve this niche problem.

## Goals

To be quite honest, weak typed languages aren't my area of expertise. This was more of an exercise in trying to write something in PHP than anything else. I'd like to port this to C# and/or Ruby at some point in time, and would appreciate any help in doing so. I'm a much stronger C# developer than I am a PHP developer.
